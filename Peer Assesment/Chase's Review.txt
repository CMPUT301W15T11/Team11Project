Cmput 301 Peer Review:


Requirements, Test cases, and UML were split up between all group members as follows:

1 : Chase
2 : Josh
3 : Alex
4 : Justin
5 : Sabrina
6 : Sabrina
7 : Josh
8 : Chase
9 : Chase

User Interface was designed by Chase, Sabrina, and Justin on whiteboard, and then transferred to inkscape by Sabrina. 

Release Planning was Done by Chase

Glossary was contributed to by all members. 


During the planning phases of our application, all members were eager to share and easy to work with. I didn't work directly with Josh or Alex (except in the lab, where both were very pleasant), but I did design the UI with Sabrina and Justin. 

Justin was full of good ideas, eager to contribute, and quick to help out when someone needed help our had questions in our group chats. 

Sabrina did a fantastic job translating our whiteboard mockup to inkscape, and brought quite a few great UI improvements along with it. 

Josh and Alex were always helpful in our groupchat, and did a fantastic work on their portions of the requirements, as well as contributing ideas to our UI. 

Unfortunately one of our group members, Rebecca, left the group after it was too late to find a new member, and before doing any work of her own. She was useless and we would have been better off without her. 

My Specific contributions were:
Requirements/TestCases/UML 1, 8 and 9
UI whiteboard planning
Release Planning

In conclusion, with the exception of one member, I have been very happy with the efforts put forth by my team so far :)
